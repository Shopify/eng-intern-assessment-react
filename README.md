*A note on styling (and lack thereof)*

As you will notice I did not style my application. I am aware and accept that this may have been a mistake - this is a front-end dev challenge after all...however, I understood the instructions (specifically "Your task is to write the code to implement the stopwatch functionality and ensure that it works correctly") to mean that what my task is not is implementing styling at my own discretion. As such I hope you understand my decision to forego this feature!

## Features

- stopwatch starts
- stopwatch stops
- stopwatch resets
- stopwatch records laps

## Running Tests
