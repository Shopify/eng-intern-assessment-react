# StopWatch Project overview:
The goal of this project is to implement a stopwatch application using React and TypeScript. The stopwatch should have the following functionality:

- Start the stopwatch to begin counting time.
- Stop the stopwatch to pause the timer.
- Displays Laps when a button is pressed.
- Reset the stopwatch to zero.

Timer behavior:

The initial buttons of the Timer should be the Start & Reset buttons.
- When Start is pressed, the Start button will change to Stop, and Reset changes to Lap.
- While the Timer is running, when the Lap button is clicked, the Lap time recorded is displayed; when the Stop button is pressed, pause the Timer & Reset button appears.
- If the Start button is clicked again, the timer continues running, If the Reset button is clicked, the Timer reset.

Unit code stopwatch functionality has been prepared and run. The stopwatch starts, stops, resets, and records laps works as expected.
