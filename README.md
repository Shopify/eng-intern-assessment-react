### Project Overview
This is a completed solution to the Shopify react intern assessment. The application is a stopwatch that provides starting, stopping, laps, and reset functionalities. I have added a loading screen for aesthetic purposes. Overall this project was very fun to make and I hope you enjoy using it just as much as I did making it ! Thank you.
