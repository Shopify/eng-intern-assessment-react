## Features

This stopwatch application isn't just about functionality; it's also about user experience and design elegance. Here are some of the extras that make this application stand out:

### Persistent Timer with Local Storage

One of the key features of this application is the use of local storage to persist the timer state:

- Session Continuity: The stopwatch time and laps are all saved in local storage, so you can close your browser or tab, and when you return, the timer picks up right where you left off.
- Lap Memory: All recorded laps are also stored, ensuring that your progress is saved through different sessions.

### Stunning Design

The application features a visually appealing design, with a keen eye for detail:

- Intuitive Interface: The stopwatch is designed to be user-friendly, allowing for easy interaction with start, stop, lap, and reset functionalities.
- Responsive Layout: Crafted to look great on devices of all sizes, ensuring a seamless experience whether you're on desktop or mobile.
- Custom Button Styles: Each button is styled with attention to detail, providing not only a pleasant aesthetic but also clear visual feedback to user interactions.

## Functionality

The stopwatch application includes the following features:

- Start/Stop: Users can start and stop the stopwatch, which counts time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

- Lap Recording: Users can record the current time as a lap, which is displayed below the stopwatch.

- Reset: Resets the stopwatch and lap times to zero.

## Testing

The project includes unit tests to ensure the functionality of the stopwatch. Run the tests using:

```bash
npm test
```
