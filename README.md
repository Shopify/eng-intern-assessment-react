## Basic Features
- **Start Button**: Starts the timer
- **Stop Button**: Stops the timer
- **Lap Button**: Creates laps as (Lap #, Lap Time, Elapsed Time, Current Time & Date)
- **Reset Button**: Resets the timer and clears all laps

## New Features
- **Dark Mode/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes for optimal visibility.
- **Lap Timing Table**: Laps are displayed in a table, providing detailed time tracking.
- **Clear Table Option**: Clear laps independently of the stopwatch, enabling continuous measurement.
- **Export Laps**: Download a CSV file of all the recorded laps for external analysis.

## Changes
- Added a `DarkModeToggle` component, allowing the appearance to be changed at the click of a button
- Added a `LapTable` component to display lap times.
- Integrated the ability to export lap times to a CSV.

## Preview Video
This enhanced stopwatch application, originally an assignment from Shopify, now includes additional features for a more comprehensive time-tracking experience. With a sleek dark/light mode functionality, a detailed lap timing table, the ability to clear laps without stopping the timer, and an export feature for laps data, this version of the stopwatch goes beyond the basics to meet advanced user needs.

## How It Works

The Enhanced Stopwatch Application is built using React and leverages state management to handle the stopwatch's functionality. The main components include:

- `StopWatch`: Manages the overall stopwatch logic and state.
- `StopWatchButton`: Provides interactive buttons for controlling the stopwatch.
- `LapTable`: Displays recorded lap times along with options to clear and export laps.
- `DarkModeToggle`: Allows users to switch between dark and light modes for user comfort.

## Testing Approach
![Alt text](image.png)

The testing approach for the Enhanced Stopwatch Application is focused on simulating real user interactions and verifying the correctness of the application's state and behavior. The React Testing Library, alongside Jest, is used to provide a robust testing environment that allows us to render components, dispatch events, and assert on the results. The tests are designed to ensure that each feature of the stopwatch works as expected and that the user interface reflects the state changes accordingly.

The main testing strategies include:

- Mocking the `localStorage` API, as it behaves differently in the test environment compared to a web browser.
- Utilizing helper functions to wait for elements to appear and to simulate sequences of user actions.
- Testing the functionality of the stopwatch to start, stop, record laps, and reset.
- Verifying the dark mode toggle updates the application's class to reflect the user's preference.
- Ensuring that the lap times can be exported correctly by mocking document creation and download behaviors.

Each test case is isolated to prevent side effects and ensure test independence. Jest's mock functions (`jest.fn()`) are used to spy on and assert that specific actions were taken, such as creating elements and appending them to the DOM.

## Example Test Case

Here's an example of a test case for the "Export Laps as CSV" functionality:

```javascript
it('exports laps as CSV', async () => {
  // Prerequisite: laps need to be created to test export functionality
  createLaps();

  // Prepare mocks for the methods used in handleExport
  const mockClick = jest.fn();
  const mockSetAttribute = jest.fn();

  // Mock document.createElement and cast the returned object to an HTMLElement
  jest.spyOn(document, 'createElement').mockImplementation((tagName) => {
    if (tagName === 'a') {
      return {
        setAttribute: mockSetAttribute,
        click: mockClick,
        href: '',
        download: '',
      } as unknown as HTMLElement;
    }
    return document.createElement(tagName);
  });

  // Mock document.body methods and cast the mock functions to the correct type
  const mockAppendChild = jest.fn();
  const mockRemoveChild = jest.fn();
  document.body.appendChild = mockAppendChild as unknown as typeof document.body.appendChild;
  document.body.removeChild = mockRemoveChild as unknown as typeof document.body.removeChild;

  // Wait for the export button to be available and simulate a click on it
  const exportButton = await waitForExportButton();
  fireEvent.click(exportButton);

  // Check that the mocked methods were called, which implies that the export functionality was triggered
  expect(mockSetAttribute).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(mockClick).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(mockAppendChild).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(mockRemoveChild).toHaveBeenCalled();

  // Clean up mocks to avoid side-effects in other tests
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});
```
