# Project Overview
The goal of this project was to implement a Stopwatch application using React and TypeScript. I designed and implemented the Stopwatch application with the following features: 

### Features/Tasks Completed ###
- Start/Stop Functionality: The stopwatch can be started to begin counting time and stopped to pause the timer.

- Lap Recording: The application allows the user to record laps by pressing the dedicated lap button. Each lap is displayed in a list with its corresponding timing.

- Reset: Users can reset the stopwatch to zero, clearing the elapsed time and lap record.
