## Description
Introducing an elegantly designed and simple-to-use stop watch, perfect for timing needs with enhanced precision and user experience. This stop watch stands out with its start, pause, and lap functions, augmented by subtle animations that make the interface intuitive and smooth. It features a responsive layout, ensuring seamless use across various devices, and incorporates a Swift UI-styled dark mode for eye comfort, especially in low-light environments.

What sets this Stop Watch apart is its reliance on setInterval to fetch Date.now() for timing, a method chosen for its superior accuracy, reducing time drift over extended periods â€“ a common issue in traditional auto-incrementation methods.

The app's architecture leverages the Context API for efficient prop passing. The modular design of the Button component not only simplifies development but also facilitates future expansion and customization.

Moreover, its cross-platform compatibility and adaptive layout make it a reliable tool for users on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices. The app has undergone rigorous user testing to ensure a frictionless and intuitive user experience.
