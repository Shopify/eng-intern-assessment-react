import React from 'react'

/* 
Requirements:
    - The stopwatch should start counting when the user clicks the start button.
    - The stopwatch should stop counting when the user clicks the stop button.
    - The stopwatch should reset to zero when the user clicks the reset button.
    - The stopwatch should record and display laps when user clicks the lap button.

We will model this stopwatch after the iOS version. This means:
    - Stopwatch timer continuously shows the running time
    - Laps are listed in descending order (latest lap first) and show the interval from last lap
    - Stop button replaces start button and vice versa
    - Reset button clears the laps and running timer
