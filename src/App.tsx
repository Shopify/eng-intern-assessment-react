/**     Application background
 * 
 *  General concept:
 *      build a stopwatch that allows the user to
 *      click the start, stop, and reset buttons.
 * 
 *      The timer will be counting up from 0, and have
 *      an accuracy of 1 second.
 * 
 *  Approach template
 *      This will require 2 main aspects to work correctly
 *      1. The time will need to be displayed correctly and
 *          work with the 3 buttons on the display
 *          For this they will be inside of a useState
 *          that will allow for constant rendering on the 
 *          display itself.
 *      2. There will need to be a boolean value that
 *          records if the watch is running or stopped.
 *          This will also be inside of a useState<boolean>
 *      
 *      By passing a time prop to the actual stopwatch
 *      this allows us to use this for updating the component.
 *      This will only be changed by the reset button.
 *      Where the start and stop will change the boolean value
 *      of the isRunning.
 * 
 *      Due to react not actually being multi threaded, We also
 *      have to take into consideration the looping not being
 *      perfect. Without the ability to work have time on one
 *      thread and other things on another thread this adds
 *      some level of variability to timing. As the timer
 *      might have to wait for a different process to run.
 * 
 *      For the lap timer, ive decided that adding a second timer
 *      and incrementing the time, then setting it to zero at the
 *      same time as the main should work fast enough, as this
 *      does not require any other loops, and behind the screen 
 *      should use minimal instructions to increment the secondary
 *      lap counter, to then also record both total time and
 *      lap time.
 *      
 *      
 *  Key Features:
 *      The stopwatch should start counting when the user clicks the start button.
 *      The stopwatch should stop counting when the user clicks the stop button.
 *      The stopwatch should reset to zero when the user clicks the reset button.
 *      The stopwatch should record and display laps when user clicks the lap button.
