# Project Submission

Welcome to my project submission :)

## Extra Packages

I installed an extra package for this project to keep consistent styling

- **Chakra UI**: Provides simple, customizable components for the app.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Setup

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to install all the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. Run the following command to start the app on http://localhost:8080

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## High-Level Design

I avoided creating extra tsx files because I wasn't sure if it was allowed

### Components

The application consists of the following main components:

- **`App.tsx`**: Acts as the container for the overall stopwatch. It contains the main logic for tracking time and recording laps, as well as the main variables.

- **`StopWatch.tsx`**: Responsible for displaying the time and lap times.

- **`StopWatchButtons.tsx`**: Houses the Start, Stop, and Lap buttons which control the stopwatch functionality.
